## 👋 Hello, I'm Ming-Long Tsai

I am currently a junior majoring in **Computer Science & Infomation Engineering** at **National Taiwan University (NTU)**.

I am not only passionate about exploring the low-level logic of machines but also fascinated by deconstructing the structures of thought and society.

### About CS

My technical core lies in **System Security** and **Low-level Systems**. I am driven by a curiosity about the structural mechanics of how computers operate.

* **Research Interests**: Currently focused on **Isolation**, **Compartment**, and **Kernel Security**.
* **Technical Skills**:
    * **Reverse Engineering**
    * Primary languages: **C/C++** and **Python**.
* **Recent Projects**:
    * **CouPro**: An incubating startup project dedicated to building a smoother coupon-sharing platform.

### About Daily Life

My reading list is currently dominated by **Continental philosophy**, occasionally interspersed with sociology and literature. 

For me, the intrigue of philosophy and sociology lies not in constructing grand narratives, but in spotting the individuals who might be overlooked within those discourses.

The social issue I currently focus on is **Homelessness**.
* From a **CS perspective**: I see this as examining how society, functioning as a system, handles its "**edge cases**."
* From a **human perspective**: Precisely because this is a neglected topic, there is a greater need for advocacy and understanding.
